1st Criteria:
HTML tags and structure were the first to do and finish, just know the structure and you're about set. I used multiple css selectors and css styles and repeating them (both selectors and styles) once I like the way it looks. I used flexbox for the majority of the website. <br>

2nd Criteria:
The design, I just experimented a lot and when the design looked the way I like then it is finished. Mostly, this process was repeated over and over.<br>

4th and 5th Criteria:
I chose a minimalist design, more on the easier to read side of the spectrum. The content used is straightforward so that no time is wasted. I mostly do not have an eye for design but I do grasp what is pleasing to the eyes and so I just adjusted the elements to how I like them to look. I also took advantage of scroll effects/animations and keyframe functions to animate some of the elements as well to add a bit of flavor to the website.<br>

5th Criteria:
Github pages has deployed my website. I followed the steps on how to deploy the website.<br>

Guided Exercise 1 had the basics so it was important to know that and be adjusted to all the properties on how HTML and CSS work together as a tandem in making a website.<br>

I struggled on finding the right properties to put on the elements, it is mostly because I am relatively new to the language and though I grasp a little bit of the concepts, it is still relatively difficult to get used to how many properties and values one element can have and how one property behaves and what values adjust these behaviors.<br>

i would like to add to the website especially on the projects part of the website because I only have maybe 2 or 3 noteworthy projects. Improve how it looks altogether, have some symmetry and adjust it with my personal twist because I just drew inspiration from a layout that looked good. I would like to have it adjusted to my own liking when I grasp more of the concepts in Web Development. <br>

One takeaway I find worth saying is that I should explore how properties work with each other especially position properties. I get them mixed up most of the time. This does not apply to just the position property but I should get used to how other properties work as well.
